# Recipes

A web app I am building with Django as a backend and React as a frontend. My goal is to build this app to store my favorite recipes and to quickly create a shopping list for myself based on which recipes I want to prepare. I am using this as a learning experience to improve my skills with Django, React, REST APIs, and Bootstrap. My goal is to use Google Tasks API to automatically export a shopping list to my task list.
