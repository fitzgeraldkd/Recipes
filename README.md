# Recipe Web App

A web app I am building with Django as a backend and React as a frontend. My goal is to build this app to store my favorite recipes and to quickly create a shopping list for myself based on which recipes I want to prepare. I am using this as a learning experience to improve my skills with Django, React, REST APIs, and Bootstrap. My goal is to use Google Tasks API to automatically export a shopping list to my task list.

## Technologies

- Backend:
  - Django
  - Django REST API
- Frontend:
  - React
  - Bootstrap
- Additional Technologies:
  - Google Tasks API

## Wishlist

Below is a list of features I am planning on implementing:
- Add/edit recipes from within the web app itself (currently only possible through the Django admin pages)
- Finish implementing the exporting of a shopping list to Google Tasks
